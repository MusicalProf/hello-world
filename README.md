# hello-world
Practicing using GitHub essentials.

My Full Name is Ra'mar Leach. I was raised in Chicago, IL.
I enjoy bowling, listening to music, coding, and reading. 
Currently, I'm working as a Capacity Coordinator II at JB Hunt. I'm searching for a junior fullstack development role, and am in the process of continued learning so as to get better at this craft of coding.
